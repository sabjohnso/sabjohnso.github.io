* SUMMARY

A computational scientist and engineering developer primarily focused on algorithm and software development for the numerical solution of differential-algebraic equations, ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, and linear and nonlinear algebraic equations pertaining to models of physical and industrial processes, especially those involving fluid dynamics, coupled fluid-structure interactions and  heat transfer.

- Development and implementation of algorithms for the automatic classification and index reduction of systems of differential-algebraic equations based on a graph-theoretic analysis of the system's structure via a modification of Pantelides' algorithm.

- Development of a template library for automatic differentiation of physical models using dual arithmetic.

- Development and implementation of a high-performance computing framework for the simulation of disparate but tightly coupled physical models using non-causal or semi-causal, canonical (residual based) model formulations that allows the complete decoupling of the specification and development of individual physical model components as well as the complete decoupling of the solver from the model resulting in a dramatic reduction in the development time and cost of simulation tools.

- Development of physical models for the numerical simulation of complex physical systems related to hydraulic fracturing and other production enhancement processes.

- Generation of best practices recommendations for the development of scientific computing and computer aid engineering software, and participated in the organization and execution of third-party reviews to improve the integrity of the organizations scientific computing software.

- Generation of process recommendations for improving the programming skills and quality of inexperienced computational scientists and engineers in an environment with insufficient experienced professionals for effective mentoring.

- Algorithmic and programming optimization of existing models and solvers resulting and multiple orders of magnitude reduction in computational time and memory requirements.
